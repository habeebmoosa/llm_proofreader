# LLM Proof Reader


## Inspiration
The increasing reliance on AI-generated content inspired us to create a tool that ensures its accuracy, clarity, and quality. We wanted to empower users with a quick way to refine and trust LLM outputs.

## What it does
LLM Proof Reader is a Chrome extension that proofreads LLM-generated content. It identifies factual errors, highlights unclear sections, and provides concise feedback to enhance grammar, tone, and overall readability.

## How we built it
We built the extension using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front end and integrated Chrome's built-in AI model for proofreading.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing a concise yet effective feedback mechanism was challenging. Ensuring seamless integration with LLM-generated content and optimizing performance in real-time were also key hurdles.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud to have created an intuitive tool that delivers precise and actionable feedback in seconds. The ability to simplify complex AI content proofreading into a browser extension is a milestone.

## What we learned
While building this extension, I learned many things, like how we can utilize in-house LLM to perform small tasks.

## What's next for LLM Proof Reader
We plan to expand the extensionâ€™s capabilities with support for multiple languages, advanced style-checking features, and integration with popular writing platforms for broader adoption.
